# Task Manager CLI App

This project is a simple command-line task manager that allows users to create, track, and manage their tasks. It is designed for individual users who want to organize their to-do items, save them permanently, and interact through a text-based menu.

- Add new tasks with:
    - Title
    - Status (completed / not completed)
    - Due date
    - Notes
- View task list
- Update or delete tasks
- Tasks are saved to a JSON file for persistence
